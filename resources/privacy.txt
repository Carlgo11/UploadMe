### How is the data you upload distributed?
When you upload something to UpLoadMe you agree on sharing your file with everyone.  
There is no way to only allow certain people to access it. However we disallow bots (like <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072">Google</a>) to crawl the uploads folder.  
That way only the people who know about the link to your file can access it.

### What do you know about me and my file?
We try to know as little as possible. We basically don't want to know who you are or what you're uploading.
When you upload something to UpLoadMe no data about you is stored. We can't even see what IP you're using.


### I want to delete my own file.
At the moment that's a bit tricky. Since we don't know who you are, we can't know that it's really you who uploaded the file.  
If you need to delete something, then contact support and we'll consider whether we think it's really you and if the file should be deleted.

### I want to delete someone else's file since it violates some law.
Cool, you know laws. Good for you!  
Yes, we will cooperate with law enforcement if they file a valid warrant.  
Keep in mind though that we know nothing about you, so there's not really anything they can gain from it.
