###Quickly upload files to your server

UploadMe is a file uploading system with privacy in mind.  
The official site is <a href="https://uploadme.carlgo11.com/">uploadme.carlgo11.com</a> but the repo can also be self-hosted easily.



### Installation for self-hosting
This guide will be describing how to setup UpLoadMe on a unix based server. While you are able to set up UpLoadMe on other OSes we won't go into those.

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/Carlgo11/UploadMe/archive/master.zip">the repo</a> and place it in your web directory.
2. do `mv config.example.php config.php` and edit the settings in config.php so that it fits your server setup.  
__That's it!__
