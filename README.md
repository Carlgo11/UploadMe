###Quickly upload files to your server

UploadMe is a file uploading system with privacy in mind.  
The official site is <a href="https://uploadme.se/">uploadme.se</a> but the repo can also be self-hosted easily.



### Installation for self-hosting
This guide will be describing how to setup UpLoadMe on a unix based server. While you are able to set up UpLoadMe on other OSes we won't go into those.

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/UploadMe/UploadMe/archive/master.zip">the repo</a> and place it in your web directory. (or do `git clone https://github.com/Carlgo11/UploadMe.git`)
2. go to  `install.php` and follow the setup instructions.
__That's it!__
